# Object-Oriented Design
## Handle Ambiguity
Ask the six W's, who, what, where, when, how and why?
## Define the Core Objects

## Analyze Relationships
Think about inheritances and what are some common features and functions
that we can put into a module instead of a class

## Investigate Actions

## Design Patterns
A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and ensures
access to the instance through the application. For example, stores in Flux
architecture are singleton, every type of data should have only one instance
of store.

Factory method offers an interface for creating an instance of a class, with
its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate.
